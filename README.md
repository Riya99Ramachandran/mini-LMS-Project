This project is a Mini Learning Management System (LMS) built using React. It features a simple and user-friendly interface with a navigation bar that allows users to switch between the Courses page and the Dashboard. Users can browse available courses, view detailed course content, and track their learning progress in an organized and interactive layout.

The Dashboard provides a visual summary of course completion using a pie chart, helping users easily understand their progress at a glance. Designed to be lightweight, responsive, and clean, this mini LMS serves as a basic but functional model for online learning platforms.
